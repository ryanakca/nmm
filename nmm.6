.Sh DESCRIPTION
Nine Men's Morris is an ancient board game, alleged to have been
played by the Romans. Gameplay is similar to Tic-Tac-Toe, with users
placing pieces in attempt to form three in a row, except that players
can additionally move their pieces and remove their opponents pieces.
.Pp
The board consists of positions connected with dashed lines, initially
marked empty (E), but then filled with black (B) and white (W) pieces.
Players place, move, and remove pieces, and the winner is the first to
reduce the opponent to 2 pieces. Gameplay is split into three phases.
.Ss Phase 1
Users alternatingly place a piece on the board, until each player has
placed 3 (tmm), 9 (nmm), or 12 (twmm) pieces. The location is selected
by entering its coordinates,
e.g\&.
.Sq a1
or
.Sq g7  .
A mill can be formed by aligning three pieces along a dashed line, at
which point an opponent's piece is removed. This piece is selected by
entering its coordinates.
.Pp
.Ss Phase 2
Users alternatingly slide one of their pieces along dashed line to an
adjacent empty position. The piece is selected by entering its
coordinates and its direction is chosen from n s e w ne nw se sw, for
North, South, East, West, North East, North West, South East, South
West (ne\(emsw are only available in twmm). Note that to move in a
direction, there must be a dashed line emanating from the piece in
that direction. For example,
.Sq a1n
moves the piece at a1 north,
.Sq g7sw
moves the piece at g7 south west. Mills are formed and pieces removed
as in phase 1.  Phase 2 continues until one player only has 3 pieces
remaining.
.Ss Phase 3
The player with three pieces may move a piece to any empty
location, e.g.
.Sq a1g7
moves the piece at a1 to location g7. The player with more than three
pieces moves as in Phase 2. The first player to reduce the opponent
to two pieces wins.
